# useradd [options] LOGIN
# useradd -b, --base-dir BASE_DIR
# The default base directory for sys if -d HOME_DIR is not specified
# If this option is not specified, useradd will use base dir specified
# by HOME variable in /etc/default/useradd OR /home by default

# useradd -c, --comment COMMENT
# Any text string, generally a short description of the login, and
# is currently used as the field for user's full name

# useradd -d, --home-dir HOME_DIR
# The new user will be created using HOME_DIR as the value for the user's
# login directory. Default is to append the LOGIN name to BASE_DIR & 

# useradd -l, --no-log-init
# Do NOT add the user to the lastlog & faillog databases
# By default, the user's entries in the lastlog & faillog databases
# are resetted to avoid reusing the entry from a previously deleted user

# useradd -m, --create-home
# Create the user's home directory if it does NOT exist.
# The files & dir contained in the skeleton directory
# (which can be defined with the -k option) will be copied to the home directory
# By default, if this option is not specified & CREATE_HOME is not enabled,
# no home directories are created.
# The directory where the user's home directory is created must exist and
# have proper SELinux context & permissions.
# Otherwise, the user's home directory cannot be created OR accessed

# useradd -M,--no-create-home

# /CONFIGURATION
# CONFIGURATION
#        The following configuration variables in /etc/login.defs change the behavior
#        of this tool:

#        CREATE_HOME (boolean)
#            Indicate if a home directory should be created by default for new users.

#            This setting does not apply to system users, and can be overridden on the
#            command line.

#        GID_MAX (number), GID_MIN (number)
#            Range of group IDs used for the creation of regular groups by useradd,
#            groupadd, or newusers.

#            The default value for GID_MIN (resp.  GID_MAX) is 1000 (resp. 60000).

#        HOME_MODE (number)
#            The mode for new home directories. If not specified, the UMASK is used to
#            create the mode.

#            useradd and newusers use this to set the mode of the home directory they
#            create.

#        LASTLOG_UID_MAX (number)
#            Highest user ID number for which the lastlog entries should be updated. As
#            higher user IDs are usually tracked by remote user identity and
#            authentication services there is no need to create a huge sparse lastlog
#            file for them.

#            No LASTLOG_UID_MAX option present in the configuration means that there is
#            no user ID limit for writing lastlog entries.
